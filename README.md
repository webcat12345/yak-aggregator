## 🐃  YY Swap

Dex aggregator for Avalanche. Use at your own risk.

UI available from https://yieldyak.com/swap

## Overview

The Avalanche C-Chain is saturated with 10+ exchanges competing ~200M of liquidity. This creates the following issues for traders:
* **Split liquidity:**
Traders are more likely to get affected by price impact and negative slippage since liquidity is split across many exchanges.
* **Disconnected assets:**
Traders need to approve and swap on multiple platforms to swap between certain assets in the Avalanche ecosystem.
* **No simple way to determine best price for swap:**
With all the options there is no clear way of knowing which exchange will offer the best price for a particular trade. 

## How it works

YY Swap solves these problems by finding and executing the most profitable trades for users.
* Multi-path trades (e.g. Pangolin > Gondola > Zero)
* Gas-cost considerations
* Easy to build on top of

## Mainnet Deployments and Supported Platforms

### Routers

YakRouter is the user-facing interface to check prices and make trades.

| Name      | Address |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| YakRouter   | `0xC4729E56b831d74bBc18797e0e17A295fA77488c` |

#### Query

Query YakRouter for the best trade execution.

**Parameters**
 - **amountIn[BigNumber]:** Amount of tokens being sold
 - **tokenIn[String]:** ERC20 token being sold (pass WAVAX address for AVAX)
 - **tokenOut[String]:** ERC20 token being bought (pass WAVAX address for AVAX)
 - **steps[BigNumber]:** Number of steps within which best path will be searched (max is 4)
 - **gasPrice[BigNumber]:** Gas price in gwei (should be 225 GWEI now, but is planned be dynamic in the future)

###### findBestPathWithGas

```js
router.findBestPathWithGas(
    amountIn, 
    tokenIn, 
    tokenOut, 
    steps, 
    gasPrice
)
```

#### Swap

Swap YakRouter to execute a trade.

**Parameters**
 - **trade[Array]:** Array of paramters used for swapping
    - **amountIn[BigNumber]:** Amount of tokens being sold
    - **amountOut[BigNumber]:** Minimum amount of tokens bought
    - **path[Array]:** Tokens being traded (in respective order)
    - **adapters[Array]:** Adapters through which tokens will be traded (in respective order)
 - **to[String]:** Address where output tokens should be sent to
 - **fee[BigNumber]:** Optional fee in bps taken before the trades

###### swapNoSplit

```js
router.swapNoSplit(trade, to, fee)
```

###### swapNoSplitToAVAX

```js
router.swapNoSplitToAVAX(trade, to, fee);
```

###### swapNoSplitFromAVAX

```js
router.swapNoSplitFromAVAX(trade, to, fee, { value: amountIn });
```


### Adapters

Adapters act as a common interface for YakRouter to interact with external contracts.

Adapters must offer methods: `query` and `swap`. 

## Local Development and testing

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### Set Environmental Variables

 * `AVALANCHE_DEPLOY_RPC` is Avalanche C-Chain RPC provider that will be used deployment [ deployment ]
 * `PK_DEPLOYER` is private-key for the account that will deploy contracts [ deployment ]

### Actions

#### Test
```
npx hardhat test {path to the test/tests | empty to run all}
```

#### Deploy
